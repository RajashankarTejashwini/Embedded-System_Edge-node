# Embedded-System_Edge-node
Module Project 2: IoT Edge Node of Your Choice
Overview
In this project, you'll think about an IoT system that you're interested in, and design one of the sensor/actuation edge nodes of that system.

Although you will not have access to the true IoT system, you can designate certain input/output features of your development kit as being connected to something in the true IoT system. For example, if you are creating an actuation component of your edge node, use the LEDs to simulate turning a motor (or other actuator) on or off.

You do not need to create the Hub component of your IoT system, as we will use the nRF Connect Desktop Bluetooth Low Energy application to make sure that your edge node behaves as you designed. During your development, you can use the nRF Connect app on your cell phone or tablet to communicate with your edge node.
